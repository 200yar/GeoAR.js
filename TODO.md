### Enhancements

~~nicolocarpignoli

- Add UX/UI and messages when location is not granted by the user (events for that should be available as for camera permissions on AR.js)
- Add UX/UI and messages when location data is not available or very poor signals (is there any events for that?)


### Demo todos

- show something at user's location
- show something near user's location
