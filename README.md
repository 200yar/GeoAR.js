# GeoAR.js

## Overview

üåçThe aim is to bring a basic but working Location Based AR system to the actual [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/) (currently marker based only).

This is still experimental and a Work In Progress.
The original version was working with some limitations, but now it's outdated (it was based on aframa 0.6.0, now we have aframe 0.9.0 version with different APIs).
The aim is to make it working with updated dependencies and possibly better performances.
Stay tuned for more!

## Credits

It is based on the discussion from this [github issue](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues/190).
It has been originated by [1d10t](https://github.com/1d10t) in this [file](https://1d10t.github.io/test/phills-sphere.html).
This project has been originally crated from Jerome Etienne as branch of AR.js and then as standalone repository but was left alone from 2017.
Now I'm trying to bring it alive again!

Thanks a LOT for your contribution! ‚ù§Ô∏è
