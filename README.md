# GeoAR.js

## Overview

üåçThe aim is to bring a basic but working Location Based AR system to the actual [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/) (currently marker based only).

This is still experimental and a Work In Progress.
The original version was working with some limitations, but now it's outdated (it was based on [aframe](https://aframe.io/) v0.6.0, now we have [aframe](https://aframe.io/) v0.9.0 version with different APIs).
The aim is to make it working with updated dependencies and possibly better performances.
Stay tuned!

## Credits

It is based on the discussion from this [github issue](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues/190).
It has been originated by [1d10t](https://github.com/1d10t) in this [file](https://1d10t.github.io/test/phills-sphere.html).
This project has been originally crated by Jerome Etienne as a branch of AR.js and then as standalone repository, but was left alone from 2017. Now I'm trying to bring it alive again!

Thanks a LOT for all contributions! ‚ù§Ô∏è
